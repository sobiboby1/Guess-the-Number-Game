Guess-the-Number-Game:
**Assess the Numeric Puzzle**


Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I created a straightforward "Guess the Number" game for this assignment. Guessing a randomly generated number between 1 and 100 is required of the user. Every estimate is noted, and the total number of tries left is shown. After every guess, the computer gives feedback indicating whether the guess was accurate, too high, or too low. 

The user can guess the number ten times in total before it is accurately identified. A button to reset the game and start over with a new random number is produced after the game is over, regardless of whether the user guesses the number correctly or runs out of attempts.
